# Stock Analysis using VBA
Refactoring an existing VBA code to increase efficiency and quality of stock analysis. 

## Overview of Project 
Steve acquired the help of a data analyst to produce a code that allows him to analyze stock datasets within seconds. However, he is concerned that if there were thousands of datasets, the code would not work as well. In this project, the original VBA code was restructured in a way that the script runs more efficiently, while continuing to maintain functionality and outputting accurate stock analysis.
